## About PreFer

PreFer data challenge focuses on the following task: for people aged 18-45 in 2020, predict who will have a(nother) child within the following three years (2021-2023) based on the data up to and including 2020. 

In the challenge, participants will use two unique data sources to make predictions: the LISS panel, a longitudinal survey based on a random representative sample of the Dutch population, and administrative data from Statistics Netherlands covering the entire Dutch population. Comparing and interpreting the models created in the challenge will help quantify the existing knowledge and gain insights.  

The data challenge will take place from the beginning of April until the end of September 2024. It is open for participants from different backgrounds.
  

PreFer is organised by the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/){target="_blank"}, [ODISSEI](https://odissei-data.nl/en/){target="_blank"}, [Eyra](https://www.eyra.co/){target="_blank"}, and [Centerdata](https://www.centerdata.nl/){target="_blank"}.  

See [here](#details-about-the-challenge) details about the methodology of the data challenge.


## Why predict fertility outcomes in a data challenge?

This data challenge can potentially advance our understanding of fertility behavior and improve social policies and family planning in several ways. Measuring how well different factors and models can predict fertility outcomes for new cases will show __which factors are more important__. It can narrow down a scope for potential interventions and help people reach their desired family size. Comparing and interpreting different models submitted to a data challenge (e.g. theory- and data-driven) can identify __new factors__ currently overlooked by the theories of fertility and  highlight the __gaps in current knowledge__ (e.g. important interactions or non-linear effects).

### Apply 

Fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/cxc7U24n5ox7A1vu7){target="_blank"} to apply for participation in the data challenge. You can find the details about applications [here](details/overview/1application.md).
__The application deadline is March 24th.__  


### Build a model 

Use any method youâ€™d like to train a predictive model using training data we provide. The models will be then evaluated on a holdout set based on the F1 score. More information about the phases of the data challenge can be found [here](/details/overview/3phases.md).

### Submit the model  

submit your model (in the case of LISS) or predictions (for CBS)...
Details about the submission here (link to submission page)
 

## Why participate
* Use unique data from the LISS panel and the Dutch population registries, including a social network for the entire Dutch population  
* Have fun learning new skills, competing with other teams, and discovering unique data while predicting an important life outcome  
* Contribute to research on fertility behaviour  
* Collaborate on scientific papers describing the results of the challenge  
* Win recognition and prizes
