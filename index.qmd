## Why predict fertility outcomes in a data challenge?

Fertility is widely studied in diverse disciplines due to its importance to individuals and societies. A lot of factors have been identified that are related to fertility outcomes. Yet these important factors only explain a fraction of the variation in fertility outcomes and we are unable to explain even their short-term changes. What do we miss?

This data challenge can potentially advance our understanding of fertility behavior and improve social policies and family planning in several ways. Measuring how well different factors and models can predict fertility outcomes for new cases will show __which factors are more important__. It can narrow down a scope for potential interventions and help people reach their desired family size. Comparing and interpreting different models submitted to a data challenge (e.g. theory- and data-driven) can identify __new factors__ currently overlooked by the theories of fertility and  highlight the __gaps in current knowledge__ (e.g. important interactions or non-linear effects).

## Why participate
* Use unique data from the LISS panel and the Dutch population registers, including a social network for the entire Dutch population*  
* Have fun learning new skills, competing with other teams, and discovering unique data while predicting an important life outcome  
* Contribute to research on fertility behaviour  
* Collaborate on scientific papers describing the results of the challenge  
* Win recognition and prizes  
  
   

*Only a selection of participants will get an opportunity to work with the register data in [Phase 2](/details/overview/3phases.md){target="_blank"} of the data challenge. For these participants the costs of access to the register datasets will be covered by ODISSEI. See __conditions for accessing the register data__ [here](/details/overview/4submission_evaluation_winners.md){target="_blank"}.

## How to participate

<!--::: {.column width="30%"}-->
### Apply 

Fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/cxc7U24n5ox7A1vu7){target="_blank"} to apply for participation in the data challenge. You can find the details about applications [here](details/overview/3application.md).
__The application deadline is March 24th.__  


### Build a model 

Use any method youâ€™d like to train a predictive model using training data we provide. The models will be then evaluated on a holdout set based on the F1 score. More information about the phases of the data challenge can be found [here](/details/overview/3phases.md).

### Submit the model  

Submit your model (in [Phase 1](/details/overview/3phases.md)) or predictions (in [Phase 2](/details/overview/3phases.md)). The link the submission platform with all the instructions how to submit will appear on this website soon.
