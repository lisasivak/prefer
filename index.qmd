## About PreFer

PreFer data challenge focuses on the following task: for people aged 18-45 in 2020, predict who will have a(nother) child within the following three years (2021-2023) based on the data up to 2020. 

In the challenge, participants will use two unique data sources to make predictions: the LISS panel, a longitudinal survey based on a random representative sample of the Dutch population, and administrative data from Statistics Netherlands covering the entire Dutch population. Comparing and interpreting the models created in the challenge will help quantify the existing knowledge, highlight the gaps, and gain insights.  

The data challenge will take place from __the beginning of March__ until __the end of September 2024__. It is open for participants from __different backgrounds__.
  

PreFer is organised by the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/){target="_blank"}, [ODISSEI](https://odissei-data.nl/en/){target="_blank"}, [Eyra](https://www.eyra.co/){target="_blank"}, and [Centerdata](https://www.centerdata.nl/){target="_blank"}.  

See [here](#details-about-the-challenge) details about the methodology of the data challenge.

## The goal

Data challenges led to progress in many fields. But rare in social sciences. this data challenge can asses the predictability

## Build a model 

Use any method you’d like to train a predictive model using training sets. The models will be then evaluated on a holdout set based on the F1 score. You can participate individually or in teams.
