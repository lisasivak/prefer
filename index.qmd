## Overview

PreFer data challenge focuses on the following task: for people aged 18-45 in 2020, predict who will have a(nother) child within the following three years (2021-2023) based on the data up to 2020. 

In the challenge, participants will use two unique data sources: the LISS panel, a longitudinal survey based on a random representative sample of the Dutch population, and administrative data from Statistics Netherlands covering the entire Dutch population. Comparing and interpreting the models created in the challenge will help quantify the existing knowledge, highlight the gaps, and gain insights.  

The data challenge will take place in Spring-Summer 2024. It is open for participants from different backgrounds.
  

PreFer is organised by the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/), [ODISSEI](https://odissei-data.nl/en/), [Eyra](https://www.eyra.co/), and [Centerdata](https://www.centerdata.nl/).
