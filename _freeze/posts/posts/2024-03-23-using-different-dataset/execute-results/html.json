([here](2024-03-20-prefer-datasets.qmd) you can find a guide on these different datasets)\n\nBelow it is assumed that you have these datasets in your working directory. \n\n# Reading-in different datasets\n## PreFer_train_data.csv\n\nThe most important dataset of the PreFer data challenge is the `PreFer_train_data.csv` dataset. This contains data on all LISS respondents who were between the ages of 18 and 45 in 2020 (i.e., had birthyears between 1975 and 2002). [Click here](2024-03-22-read-data.qmd) for an explanation on how to quickly read-in the data \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(data.table) # requires install.packages(\"data.table\") first\ndata <- data.table::fread(\"path/to/folder/PreFer_train_data.csv\", \n                          keepLeadingZeros = TRUE, # if FALSE adds zeroes to some dates\n                          data.table = FALSE) # returns a data.frame object rather than data.table \n```\n:::\n\n\n## PreFer_train_background_data.csv\n\nThe `PreFer_background_data.csv` contains data on particularly variables on a monthly basis for each respondent. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbackground <- data.table::fread(\"path/to/folder/PreFer_train_background_data.csv\", \n                                keepLeadingZeros = TRUE, \n                                data.table = FALSE) \n```\n:::\n\n\n## PreFer_train_supplementary_data.csv\n\nThe `PreFer_train_supplementary_data.csv` contains data on LISS respondents that did not fall in our target group, i.e., had birthyears lower than 1975 or higher than 2002. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsupplement <- data.table::fread(\"path/to/folder/PreFer_train_supplementary_data.csv\", \n                                keepLeadingZeros = TRUE, \n                                data.table = FALSE) \n```\n:::\n\n\n# How to usefully combine datasets\n\n## Using information from background data\n\nOne could use the background data to enhance the train data (`PreFer_train_data.csv`). For example, imagine that you would want to add the average income of respondents in the last three months prior to 2021. Here is what one could add to the `submission.R` script:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) # for data wrangling\n\n# creating average income for all respondents\nincome_3months <- background %>% \n  # only select last 3 months\n  filter(wave >= 202010 & wave <= 202012) %>% \n  # for each respondent\n  group_by(nomem_encr) %>% \n  # calculate average income\n  summarise(mean_income = mean(netinc, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# add income to train data\ndata <- left_join(data, income_3months, by = \"nomem_encr\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo make this work don't forget to add `\"tidyverse\"` to `packages.R`! [Here](LINKTOGITHUBBRANCH) you can see that it passes the check.\n\n## Using information from the supplementary data\n\nUsing information from the supplementary data is slightly more complex. Remember that the supplementary data (`PreFer_train_supplementary_data.csv`) consists of all people who are not in the target group (i.e., it consists of respondents with birthyears prior to 1975 and post 2002). In contrast to the background data, where a `PreFer_train_background_data.csv` is available (to participants) and where a` PreFer_holdout_background_data.csv` exists (but is not available to PreFer participants), there is no equivalent of the supplementary data for the holdout data. This means that we *cannot* use any code to process the supplementary data in the function `clean_df`, because everything inserted into `clean_df` will be applied to holdout data. Thus, everything you do with the supplementary data must be specified in the training.R file. \n\nImagine that you also want to include people who were born in 1974 in your train data. You could insert something like the below in your `train_save_model` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) # for data wrangling\n\n# creating average income for all respondents\nrespondents_1974 <- supplement %>% \n  # only select last 3 months\n  filter(birthyear_bg == 1974) #\n\n# add respondents from 1974\ndata <- bind_rows(data, respondents_1974)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd then use your usual method to train on the data. This will work because your method will make use of these new cases, but the structure of the dataset has not changed (no new variables were added). If you would create a novel variable on the basis of the supplementary data and use this variable in your model, it would not work on the holdout data, because that variable will not exist in the holdout data. [Here](LINKTOGITHUBBRANCH) you can see that it passes the check.",
