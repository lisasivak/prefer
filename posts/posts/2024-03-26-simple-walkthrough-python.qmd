Here we describe how to prepare and make a submission for Python users. The data preprocessing and the model that we will train here is very basic. The sole purpose of this script is to make the submission process more clear.  


Steps:  

1. Do all the prerequisite steps described   [here](https://github.com/eyra/fertility-prediction-challenge?tab=readme-ov-file#prerequisites){target="_blank"}


Note: in this example we assume that you are using [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop), which is a very convenient tool for updating your github repository. [Here](https://github.com/eyra/fertility-prediction-challenge/wiki) you can find useful links how to use GitHub Desktop for cloning your repository and for update the files in it.
