Phase 1 is predicting the outcome using only the LISS data. Participants will be able to download the LISS training data on their own devices and run their methods locally. They will submit their methods through a submission platform. The first phase will take place in April-May 2024. The winner of Phase 1 will be determined based on F1 score.

Then, based on the results of the first phase, several of the best-performing teams will be selected for the second phase to work inside the secure Remote Access (RA) CBS environment. The second phase will take place approximately in June-September 2024.
