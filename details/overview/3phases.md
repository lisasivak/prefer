## Phase 1  

In Phase 1, participants will predict the outcome using only the [LISS data](/details/overview/2data.md). Participants will be able to download the LISS training data on their own devices (after accepting the user statement; all the instructions will be sent to the registered participants) and run their methods on their own computers. 

Phase 1 will begin on April 1, 2024. At the beginning of June, based on all the submissions that teams make by this date, we will select several of the best-performing teams __(10-20 teams)__ into Phase 2 (see details about the selection criteria [here](/details/overview/4submission_evaluation_winners.md){target="_blank"}).  

Other participants will continue to participate in Phase 1, which will end on September 30, 2024. The winners of Phase 1 will then be determined based on the quantitative and qualitative criteria described [here](/details/overview/4submission_evaluation_winners.md){target="_blank"})

## Phase 2  

In Phase 2, the selected participants will work inside the secure Remote Access (RA) CBS environment. The second phase will take place from July 17 to September 30, 2024. You can read about how teams will be __selected__ to participate in Phase 2 and the __conditions for accessing the CBS data__ [here](/details/overview/4submission_evaluation_winners.md){target="_blank"}.  

Phase 2 includes two tracks which differ on the holdout set for which the participants will predict the outcome (see the figure below). Participants themselves can choose which track(s) they will work on. In the first track, participants will predict the fertility outcome for the LISS holdout set. This is similar to Phase 1, but the difference is that the LISS data can be linked to CBS data inside the RA environment. In the second track, participants will instead predict the fertility outcome for the CBS holdout set. This setup provides the participants of both tracks of Phase 2 with a unique opportunity to develop and test multiple approaches to possibly enhance the performance of their methods by using both datasets.
