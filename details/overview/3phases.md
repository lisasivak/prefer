The challenge includes two phases (Figure 1). The first phase is predicting the outcome using only the LISS data. Participants will be able to download the LISS training data on their own devices and run their models locally. They will submit their methods through a submission platform. Then, based on the results of the first phase, several of the best performing teams will be selected for the second phase. This second phase includes two tracks. In the first track, participants will predict the fertility outcome on the basis of the CBS data and their submission will be evaluated on the CBS holdout data. In the second track, participants will continue to work on LISS data. Participants themselves can choose which track(s) they will work on. During the second phase, participants will work inside the secure Remote Access (RA) CBS environment. This enables linking LISS data to the CBS data, which the participants can use to leverage the strength of both datasets and augment their training data. For example, LISS data can be enhanced by neighbourhood data on the basis of the CBS data.  

Access to CBS data and the CBS RA environment is governed by strict rules and regulations in relation to data protection and privacy. One consequence of such rules is that access to this RA environment is only possible from the EU and several other countries. Another constraint of working in the CBS RA environment is that computing resources are constrained. Given the limitations, only a selection of teams can participate in the second phase. Around 20 teams will be selected for this phase and will be allowed to access the CBS RA environment.
