Phase 1 is predicting the outcome using only the [LISS data](/details/overview/2data.md). Participants will be able to download the LISS training data on their own devices and run their methods locally. They will submit their methods through a submission platform. The first phase will take place in April-May 2024. The winner of Phase 1 will be determined based on F1 score.

Then, based on the results of Phase 1, several of the best-performing teams will be selected for Phase 2 to work inside the secure Remote Access (RA) CBS environment. The second phase will take place approximately in June-September 2024.
