The goal of the data challenge is to assess the current predictability of individual-level fertility and improve our understanding of fertility behaviour. The results of the data challenge will be used to answer the following research questions: 

* How well can we predict who will have a(nother) child in the short-term future in the Netherlands?  
* What are the most important predictors of this fertility outcome?   
* Are there novel predictors for this fertility outcome, unaccounted for in the existing theoretical literature? (this can include non-linear effects, and interactions between predictors)  
* How do theory-driven methods compare to data-driven in terms of predictive accuracy?  
* What poses larger constraints on predicive ability: the number of cases or the number of (‘subjective’) variables? Survey data typically consists of thousands of variables (including subjective measures like intentions or values) on a relatively small sample (at least for data science projects; Garip). Population registries typically contain fewer variables only on a set of ‘objective’ measures (e.g., income, education, cohabiation) but describe a large number of people.
