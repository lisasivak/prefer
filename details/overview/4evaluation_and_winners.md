__Truth criteria__
To calculate the outcome for the LISS data, we used the data from the “Family and household” Core study about the number of children in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 (“How many living children do you have in total?”). On the basis of these variables, we calculated whether a person had at least one new child in 2021-2023. LISS data from the “Family and Household” 2023 study will be made available only after the end of the data challenge. 
In the case of CBS, we used the CBS dataset Kindoudertab that links children with their parents and the data containing the year of birth for each resident of the Netherlands. Based on that, for each person in the sample (Dutch population aged 18-45 in 2020), we calculated the number of children born in 2021-2023 and then derived whether or not a person had at least one new child in 2021-2023.
