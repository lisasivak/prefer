[Phase 1 and track 3 of Phase 2](/details/overview/3phases.md) of the data challenge are open for everyone. There will be a winner determined based on the results of Phase 1/track 3 of Phase 2. All of the participants who make at least one working submission in any phase and track of the data challenge will get an opportunity to co-author a community paper about the challenge or submit a paper to the special issue. 

Certain requirements must be met to participate in tracks 1-2 of [Phase 2](/details/overview/3phases.md){target="_blank"} of PreFer. During this phase of the challenge, participants of tracks 1-2 will have access to the Dutch registry data. The access to this data is governed by strict rules and regulations in relation to data protection and privacy. Only a limited number of Phase 1 participants will get the opportunity to participate in these tracks.
