To apply for the data challenge, we will ask you to fill in a google form (soon the application will open and we will add the link; in the meantime, you can sign up [here](https://forms.gle/PkVLLSmzFefvsvSw9) to get notified when the application opens).  

__Who can apply to participate in PreFer?__  

Everyone can apply, no matter the background
because anyone can participate in the [Phase 1](/details/overview/3phases.md) of the data challenge. There will be a winner determined after Phase 1. All of the Phase 1 participants who make at least one working submissions will get an opportunity to co-author a community paper about the challenge or submit a paper to the special issue. 
Certain requirements must be met to participate in both two phases of PreFer.
